# Python_Simple_Calculator
Calculator App

This calculator will only be able to ADD, MULTIPLY and SUBTRACT integers. Users will be required to put in their two integers on different lines, then input the type of calculation they want to make. 

The first task is going to be to read the first number the user must input. Give the user a prompt of “>> ”. This will let the user know that they are expected to input something.

Read the input and store it to a variable. Now prompt the user for a second integer.

Now that you have both of the user’s numbers, you will print to the user 

Your numbers are <First number> and <Second number>

where first and second numbers are what the user inputted.

Next the user will be offered the options between ADD, MULTIPLY or SUBTRACT. The user should select one of the options by typing in the corresponding operator. If the user selects another option, the program should print “Sorry, that option is not supported” and exit the program.

Finally the program should tell the user their result by printing “Your result is *****”.
